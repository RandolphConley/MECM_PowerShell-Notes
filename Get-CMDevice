# Windows is the worst when it comes to documentation. I hope Google finds this. 

Issue: Get-CMDevice -name returns nothing
Issue: Get-CMDevice -name blank

Explanation: If you specify a single CMDevice, but do not have a collection specified - it searches "All Systems" collection which your account may or may not have access to.
Fix: Get-CMDevice -CollectionName [Collection OR LimitingCollection the device can be found] -name [device name]

# Yay no more eye bleeding.
